# Available format_preset options:
# Money:
# - currency_usd: This format is used for monetary values in USD, adding the "$" symbol in front of the formatted number.
# Example: 1234567 becomes "$1.23M" (large numbers are formatted with 'K', 'M', 'B').
#
# Number:
# - humanize: This format humanizes large numbers by adding commas for better readability.
# Example: 1234567 becomes "$1.23M" (large numbers are formatted with 'K', 'M', 'B').
#
# Storage:
# - YB: Yottabytes (2^80 bytes)
# - ZB: Zettabytes (2^70 bytes)
# - EB: Exabytes (2^60 bytes)
# - PB: Petabytes (2^50 bytes)
# - TB: Terabytes (2^40 bytes)
# - GB: Gigabytes (2^30 bytes)
# - MB: Megabytes (2^20 bytes)
# - KB: Kilobytes (2^10 bytes)
# - Bytes: Standard bytes unit (2^0)
#
# Storage values will scale automatically:
# - If the value exceeds 1024 in the given unit, it will scale up to the next larger unit.
# - If the value is below 1, it will scale down to the next smaller unit.
# Example 1: 1024 GB becomes 1 TB.
# Example 2: 0.5 GB becomes 512 MB.
#
# Percentage:
# - percentage: This format multiplies the value by 100 and adds the "%" symbol.
# Example: 0.25 becomes "25.00z%".
#
# Expression Aliases:
# - Expressions can reference other measures by using the alias syntax, which starts with `$` followed by the alias name.
# - These aliases can be used in multiple expressions to represent their calculated values.
# Example: The expression "$ingress_gb + $egress_gb" sums the values of the `ingress_gb` and `egress_gb` measures.
# - Aliases can be used recursively in other expressions, enabling modular and flexible calculations.
# View settings:
# - The `is_default` property is used to set the default view for the dashboard.
# - Only one view can be set as the default view.
# - If no `All` view in config file, we automatically add `All` view with all measures and dimensions.
# - If no default view is set, the `All` view will be used as the default view.
